# QuantCoder_FS — Full-Stack AI Assistant for Traders

QuantCoder_FS is a full-stack application for quantitative finance research and trading strategy development. It leverages LLM-driven workflows and integrates them into a modular, user-friendly platform. This open-source release focuses on the summarization workflow, with other workflows in development including fundamentals analysis, strategy generation, forecasting, and risk evaluation.

This repository includes a FastAPI backend (with CrewAI-powered agents) and a responsive Next.js frontend. A preview of the complete working interface is available in the `QuantCoder_FS_Demo` folder. Technical documentation and development log are maintained on Medium and their links are available at the end of
the file. LLM pair-coding principles, agentic architectures and project roadmap have been described in several articles available on the publication list below.

## Architecture Overview

The application is structured as a modular full-stack platform:

- **Backend**: FastAPI application with modular routers, agents, and workflow orchestration
- **Frontend**: Next.js with Tailwind styling, featuring dynamic components and JWT-based authentication
- **Communication**: RESTful API endpoints with secure token-based access control

---

## Authentication

QuantCoder_FS features a secure, stateless authentication system based on JWT tokens.

- Login via `/login` stores token in `localStorage`
- Protected routes (e.g., `/summarisation`) validate token presence and redirect if unauthenticated
- Token decoding and user state are handled via a custom React hook (`useAuth`)
- Role-based access control and token refresh support are planned

---

## Quickstart Guide

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SL-Mar/QuantCoder.git
cd QuantCoder
git checkout dev
```

### 2. Backend Setup (Windows)
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Configure `.env` with your OpenAI API key:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
MODEL_NAME=gpt-4
```

Start the backend:
```bash
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Access API documentation: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

### 3. Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/summarisation](http://localhost:3000/summarisation)

Ensure backend is running. Proxy settings can be configured in `next.config.js`.

## Current Workflow: Summarization

The summarization workflow enables AI-assisted extraction of insights from uploaded PDF documents.

### Features
- Drag-and-drop PDF upload with preview
- On-demand summarization via backend workflow
- Summary rendering with LaTeX-style formatting
- Save/load/delete summaries with persistent state
- Sidebar view of all saved summaries

### Backend Structure
```

├── models/                # Pydantic schemas
└── utils/                 # File and authentication utilities
```

### Frontend Structure

## Planned Workflows

QuantCoder_FS is designed for extensibility. The following workflows are planned:

- Fundamentals Analysis (via EODHD API)
- Code Generation for QuantConnect
- Risk Modeling (including VaR and Monte Carlo tools)
- Time Series Forecasting (XGBoost-based pipeline)
- Investment Scoring & Lead Evaluation

Each workflow will include both backend orchestration and frontend interface components.

---

## Legacy CLI Version

The original prototype (QuantCoder CLI) is available on the `quantcoder-legacy` branch. It includes:

- Article search and PDF summarization
- Trading strategy generation for QuantConnect
- CLI interface

To access:
```bash
git checkout quantcoder-legacy
```
